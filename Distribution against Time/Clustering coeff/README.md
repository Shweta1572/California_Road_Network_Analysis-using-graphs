We have runned all the commands as it we ahve runned in the a part of Q3.
the name of shell script here is also q3a.sh.
What we are doing is that after the file is processed, we run avg_coeff.py in that file and it gives us the coefficient.
We have to do it iteratively to get for all 10 plots.

We have taken a sample data from the original data and for the sake of convenience, we
have taken a smaller dataset and operated upon it. 

We use the test_f.txt and then run clustering_coeff.py to get the coefficient.

The output and result is stored in clustering_coeff.csv.
We use a python file plot.py to generate a scatter plot for the data in the spreadsheet.

The plot is stored as plot.png.
We can say that the correlation is that as low the clustering coefficient, less the time.
